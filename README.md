# Image to Pencil Sketch Conversion with Python

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to convert an image into a pencil sketch using Python and OpenCV. The process involves converting an image to grayscale, inverting it, blurring the inverted image, and then combining it with the original grayscale image to create a pencil sketch effect.

## Features

- Convert any image into a pencil sketch.
- Compare the original image and the pencil sketch side by side.
- Reusable function to process multiple images.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed, along with the following libraries:

- **OpenCV** (`cv2`)
- **Matplotlib**

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python matplotlib
